# M1_To_Do_Application

Coding Temple - Module 1 Project - A simple to-do list application built in Python. Features include adding tasks, viewing tasks with indices, deleting specific tasks, and clearing the entire list. Includes input validation and error handling for a smooth user experience.

Overview
This is a simple To-Do List Application built in Python as part of the Coding Temple - Module 1 Project. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently through a menu-driven interface. Features include adding tasks, viewing tasks, deleting specific tasks, deleting all tasks, and exiting the program.

Features
1.Add Tasks: Users can add multiple tasks to their to-do list.
2.View Tasks: Displays all the tasks in the list with their respective indices.
3.Delete Specific Task: Allows users to delete a task by specifying its number.
4.Delete All Tasks: Clears the entire to-do list after confirmation.
5.Quit Application: Safely exits the program with a friendly message.

How to Use
1.Run the program in a Python environment.
2.Follow the interactive prompts in the menu:
A: Add a task to the to-do list.
B: View all tasks currently in the list.
C: Delete a specific task by selecting its number.
D: Delete all tasks after confirmation.
E: Quit the application.

Error Handling
The application validates all user inputs and handles invalid entries gracefully:
Ensures the input matches the menu options (A, B, C, D, or E).
Validates task numbers when deleting specific tasks.
Handles cases where the list is empty (e.g., trying to delete a task when there are none).

Learning Outcomes
Handling user inputs with validation.
Managing lists and operations like adding, deleting, and enumerating tasks.
Using exception handling (try-except) to handle invalid inputs.
Structuring code with functions for modular design.

Future Enhancements
1.Save tasks to a file so they persist between sessions.
2.Allow editing of existing tasks.
3.Add sorting functionality for tasks.
